# watershed-script


my first repository

trying to create better code and more functionality for my watershed delineation script. Any suggestions on adding in useful functions or a class or two would be greatly appreciated.  I'm a super newb to python and programming in general so overly complicated suggetions may not help me much.  

I'd like to add in some batch processing steps for calculating riparian buffers, their areas, stream reach lengths, etc...
